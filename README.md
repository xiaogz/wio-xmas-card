## About
This is a small electronic holiday card that plays jingle bell chorus with
a small message. I hacked it for my wife for Christmas. Now I cleaned it up
a bit. Hope this can be used by other Wio Terminal tinkerers as a spring board
to more cool stuff!

- hardware:
  - [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html)
- IDE:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [PlatformIO IDE](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest//integration/ide/vscode.html#installation) (visual studio code extension)

  - Connect Wio Terminal to computer.
  - Turn on Wio Terminal (flick the side switch to middle).

  - You can press the middle blue button on top of the screen to pause the music.
